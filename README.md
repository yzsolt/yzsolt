### Szia! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zsolt BÃ¶lÃ¶ny `[Ê’olt bÃ¸lÃ¸ni]`. I'm a software engineer from Hungary.

#### The past

I've worked with **C++** for 5 years professionally, which was enough time to encounter most of its weirdness. As a generalist I've worked on buildsystems (CMake, Gradle), tools (Python), platform-specific bindings (Java, Objective-C++), continuous integration, embedded ARM (Yocto Linux) and mobile platforms (Android, iOS). Just like any other developer I've fixed countless bugs, participated in feature development from ground zero to release, found and removed performance bottlenecks, helped in architecture planning, sat on probably too many meetings and drank probably too much â˜•.

#### The present

Nowadays I'm using **Rust** exclusively for my pet projects, since I love it and I believe it is the way forward. I try to help the ecosystem improve by sponsoring Rust projects and occasionally contributing to them.

#### Interests

I was always interested in **game development** (okay, who's wasn't?). I wrote my BSc thesis about realtime Physically Based Rendering in 2016. You can find the accompanying simple OpenGL renderer [here](https://github.com/yzsolt/szakdolgozat) (beware: it's _old_). Nowadays I'm working on a (currently private) game development related project and maintain some Rust libraries: [meshopt-rs](https://github.com/yzsolt/meshopt-rs), [netcode-rs](https://github.com/yzsolt/netcode-rs).

**WebGPU**, especially the [Rust implementation](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) by `gfx-rs` folks is an awesome project which helped me relive my interest in graphics programming after a weeks long RGB triangle experiment with Vulkan. I use `wgpu-rs` for a private project and try to help with small issues when I've got time for it.

I was working on automotive navigation for years which got me interested in _maps_ â€“ especially **OpenStreetMap** â€“ and related functionalities (geocoding, routing, map rendering, etc.). I've created the [ROSM Project](https://github.com/rosm-project), which is a set of tools written in Rust for OSM data processing, currently without a clear end goal.

#### The future

I'd love to work with Rust professionally, ideally on a topic I'm interested in.
